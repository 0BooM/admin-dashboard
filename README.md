# admin-dashboard

This project helped me to understand grid and flexbox more. I learned how to make the exact layout I want, using grid.
I had to search internet and get help by looking at others sites to help myself with some ideas (I know I shouldn't be doing that but mainly it was about good loking box-shadow or other color elements). I had a trouble with setting up the project first but then I did it (of course with some help from the Google Chrome :D). But finally I am proud of myself that I did it and I know how the grid works (of course I need to practice more because one project won't make me a grid god).
